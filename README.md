# Tree Structures Laboratory Work

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation and experimental analysis of three search tree data structures for the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course laboratory work.

## 🌳 Implemented Data Structures
1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Basic implementation
2. **AVL Tree** - Self-balancing tree with strict height balance
3. **Red-Black Tree** - Self-balancing tree with color properties

## 🚀 Features
- Complete implementation of all tree operations
- All traversal algorithms (preorder, inorder, postorder, level-order)
- Experimental analysis with thousands of keys
- Graphical visualization of results
- Comprehensive demonstration of operations

## 📊 Experiments Conducted
1. **Experiment 4:** BST height vs number of keys
2. **Experiment 5:** AVL vs Red-Black with random keys
3. **Experiment 6:** AVL vs Red-Black with sorted keys
